-- Phase 5: Transactional Outbox (EVT-009).
-- Events are written here in the SAME transaction as the reservation state change;
-- the OutboxRelay scheduled publisher reads PENDING/FAILED rows and publishes them
-- to Kafka, then marks them PUBLISHED. This removes the dual-write between the
-- database and Kafka (coding-standards §Outbox & Event Publishing).
